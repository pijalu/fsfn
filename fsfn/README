PREREQUISITE:
=============
a) patched sony_acpi:
---------------------
To use fsfn, please first compile and install sony_acpi kernel module. It's available at http://download.berlios.de/fsfn/sony_acpi.tar.gz .

	wget http://download.berlios.de/fsfn/sony_acpi.tar.gz
	tar zxvf sony_acpi.tar.gz
	cd sony_acpi
	make && sudo make install 

Check if the module fit your kernel
Code:

	modprobe sony_acpi
	ls /proc/acpi/sony

You should see

	brightness  brightness_default  fnkey

If fine, add sony_acpi to your autoloaded modules (check documentation of your distribution if needed)

b) xosd:
--------
You will need xosd if you want OSD output. see http://freshmeat.net/projects/xosd/ for informations.

You can still compile/install and use fsfn without XOSD, using `--disable-xosd' configure flag (./configure --disable-xosd) but this is not recommended since you will miss a really sweet option of fsfn.

INSTALLATION:
=============
Check INSTALL documents.

USAGE:
======
See `man fsfn' and `man 5 fsfn' for usage.

BUGS/PROBLEMS:
==============
Post them at http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=4604

LAST NOTE:
==========
Have fun with your laptop, and remember
	
	Computers are like air conditioners. 
	Both stop working, if you open windows.
