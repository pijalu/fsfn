# When a function key combination is pressed, some kernel output is usually
# generated because there is no binding for that scancode. To prevent filling up
# your kernel logs with unnecessary output, uncomment the following two lines
# and adjust them if needed. 112 should be a safe keycode in most cases.

#SCANCODE=e075
#KEYCODE=112
